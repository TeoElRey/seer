### motion_detection:
Expansive computer vision set to detect any motion (down to the movement of eyes!) and create an interactive visual representation in the form of a bokeh graph using specific timestamps of when motion entered and left the frame. Graph is used to analyze clusters of motion to conclude when background is most active through the respective timestamps that motion was occurring.

### face_detection:
Basic opencv algorithm designed to detect frontal faces (through images only for now)
